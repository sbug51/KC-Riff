## Importing a fine tuned adapter from Safetensors weights

First, create a `Modelfile` with a `FROM` command pointing at the base model you used for fine tuning, and an `ADAPTER` command which points to the directory with your Safetensors adapter:

```dockerfile
FROM <base model name>
ADAPTER /path/to/safetensors/adapter/directory
```

Make sure that you use the same base model in the `FROM` command as you used to create the adapter otherwise you will get erratic results. Most frameworks use different quantization methods, so it's best to use non-quantized (i.e. non-QLoRA) adapters. If your adapter is in the same directory as your `Modelfile`, use `ADAPTER .` to specify the adapter path.

Now run `kc-riff create` from the directory where the `Modelfile` was created:

```shell
kc-riff create my-model
```

Lastly, test the model:

```shell
kc-riff run my-model
```

kc-riff supports importing adapters based on several different model architectures including:

  * Llama (including Llama 2, Llama 3, Llama 3.1, and Llama 3.2);
  * Mistral (including Mistral 1, Mistral 2, and Mixtral); and
  * Gemma (including Gemma 1 and Gemma 2)

You can create the adapter using a fine tuning framework or tool which can output adapters in the Safetensors format, such as:

  * Hugging Face [fine tuning framework](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/training)
  * [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth)
  * [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx)


## Importing a model from Safetensors weights

First, create a `Modelfile` with a `FROM` command which points to the directory containing your Safetensors weights:

```dockerfile
FROM /path/to/safetensors/directory
```

If you create the Modelfile in the same directory as the weights, you can use the command `FROM .`.

Now run the `kc-riff create` command from the directory where you created the `Modelfile`:

```shell
kc-riff create my-model
```

Lastly, test the model:

```shell
kc-riff run my-model
```

kc-riff supports importing models for several different architectures including:

  * Llama (including Llama 2, Llama 3, Llama 3.1, and Llama 3.2);
  * Mistral (including Mistral 1, Mistral 2, and Mixtral);
  * Gemma (including Gemma 1 and Gemma 2); and
  * Phi3

This includes importing foundation models as well as any fine tuned models which have been _fused_ with a foundation model.
## Importing a GGUF based model or adapter

If you have a GGUF based model or adapter it is possible to import it into kc-riff. You can obtain a GGUF model or adapter by:

  * converting a Safetensors model with the `convert_hf_to_gguf.py` from Llama.cpp; 
  * converting a Safetensors adapter with the `convert_lora_to_gguf.py` from Llama.cpp; or
  * downloading a model or adapter from a place such as HuggingFace

To import a GGUF model, create a `Modelfile` containing:

```dockerfile
FROM /path/to/file.gguf
```

For a GGUF adapter, create the `Modelfile` with:

```dockerfile
FROM <model name>
ADAPTER /path/to/file.gguf
```

When importing a GGUF adapter, it's important to use the same base model as the base model that the adapter was created with. You can use:

 * a model from kc-riff
 * a GGUF file
 * a Safetensors based model 

Once you have created your `Modelfile`, use the `kc-riff create` command to build the model.

```shell
kc-riff create my-model
```

## Quantizing a Model

Quantizing a model allows you to run models faster and with less memory consumption but at reduced accuracy. This allows you to run a model on more modest hardware.

kc-riff can quantize FP16 and FP32 based models into different quantization levels using the `-q/--quantize` flag with the `kc-riff create` command.

First, create a Modelfile with the FP16 or FP32 based model you wish to quantize.

```dockerfile
FROM /path/to/my/gemma/f16/model
```

Use `kc-riff create` to then create the quantized model.

```shell
$ kc-riff create --quantize q4_K_M mymodel
transferring model data
quantizing F16 model to Q4_K_M

```

## Sharing your model on kc-riff.com

You can share any model you have created by pushing it to [kc-riff.com](https://killchaos.app) so that other users can try it out.

First, use your browser to go to the [kc-riff Sign-Up](https://killchaos.app/signup) page. If you already have an account, you can skip this step.

The `Username` field will be used as part of your model's name (e.g. `jmorganca/mymodel`), so make sure you are comfortable with the username that you have selected.

Now that you have created an account and are signed-in, go to the [kc-riff Keys Settings](https://killchaos.app/settings/keys) page.

Follow the directions on the page to determine where your kc-riff Public Key is located.

<img src="images/kc-riff-keys.png" alt="kc-riff Keys" width="80%">

Click on the `Add kc-riff Public Key` button, and copy and paste the contents of your kc-riff Public Key into the text field.

To push a model to [kc-riff.com](https://killchaos.app), first make sure that it is named correctly with your username. You may have to use the `kc-riff cp` command to copy
your model to give it the correct name. Once you're happy with your model's name, use the `kc-riff push` command to push it to [kc-riff.com](https://killchaos.app).

```shell
kc-riff cp mymodel myuser/mymodel
kc-riff push myuser/mymodel
```

Once your model has been pushed, other users can pull and run it by using the command:

```shell
kc-riff run myuser/mymodel
```
